# Hello-World
My First Repository

This is my coding journey (to date)...

The year was 2018, and during that summer I had an idea for a moble application. I'll save you the details. Having come to a personal understanding that I wanted to be an entreprenuer in the months, maybe year prior I had been in search for something I could really latch on to. At the time I had no real technical understanding, besides personal use of a computer, aka the ability to play videogames, surf the web and...oh idk, other computer stuff. So asked a friend to be the technical counterpart that could help build from the ground up. Long Story short, it went no where. Mostly due to a true sense of initiative and understanding what to do, A little part being it was down on the list of priorities for my technical counterpart and definitely just me personally, not being ready.

In this short expereince I realized that if I ever wanted to really do something I needed to understand the market (industry expereince), be scrappy enough technically to build an initial product, and a real partnership with other co-founders who had a real sense of drive. So... here I am, 3 years later (or should I say 4 since this is the 2nd day of 2022) after going to SF to be in startup land, initially as a recruiter, then quickly pivoted to being an SDR after a year to learn how to drive pipeline ($$$) but not being passionate about sales to commit, deciding to finally and truly invest the time, money and sweat to develop the technical literacy I think I need. Later this month I'll be attending a software bootcamp.
